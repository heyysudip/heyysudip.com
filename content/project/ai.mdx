## Introduction

This is an AI chatbot powered by Google's Gemini Pro 1.0 and Vercel's AI SDK with seamless user experience and a beautiful UI. It is built with Next.js, Gemini, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. It also uses Supabase.

Throughout the project, I have tried to maintain a clean and readable codebase with proper comments and documentation. I have also tried to maintain a good folder structure and naming conventions.

## Goal

In this modern era of web development, user experience has become a very important factor.

Traditionally, web applications with complex functionalities like AI chatbots do not excel in user experience. This project aims to solve that problem by providing a seamless user experience with a beautiful UI.

Throughout the project, I kept the user experience in mind and tried to make it as seamless as possible. I also tried to make the UI as beautiful as possible by adding animations and gradients.

The authentication flow is also seamless and the user data is stored in Supabase. It doesn't even feels like the user is signing in or signing up. It's just a smooth experience.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used is Nextjs with combination of Shadcn UI and tailwind css for a pleasing and beautiful UI giving a seamless user experience.

Supabase is used to seamlessly add user authentication and store user data using it's brand new `@supabase/ssr` package.

Vercel AI SDK is used to seamlessly use Gemini Pro both on the client and server side.

Zod is used both on the client and server side to validate the user input.

Nodemailer is used for sending feedback emails.

## Features

Seamless authentication using Supabase with the help of `@supabase/ssr` package. Which allowed me to use server actions for authentication with ease.

With Supabase in the backend, the user data is stored in a secure and reliable database.

Seamless AI chat experience with a streaming UI, which makes the user feel like they are chatting with a real human. All thanks to Vercel's AI SDK which provides an easy to use hook `useChat` to use Gemini Pro or any other AI model.

Markdown support in the chat. The chatbot supports markdown which makes the chat more interactive and beautiful. This is done using `mdast-util-from-markdown`.

Code highlighting in the chat. This is done using `react-syntax-highlighter`. The code is highlighted based on the language of the code. This makes the chat more interactive and beautiful.

Form validation using `zod` and `react-hook-form`. This makes the form more interactive and beautiful. The user gets instant feedback about the form validation.

Feedback form in case the user wants to give feedback about the chatbot. The feedback is sent to the my email using `nodemailer`. This is a very important feature as it helps me to improve the chatbot.

## Problems

The main problem I faced while developing is, parsing the markdown and highlighting the code in the chat. This was a bit tricky as I had to use `mdast-util-from-markdown` and `highlight.js` to achieve this. 

It took me some time to understand how to use these libraries and then I was able to implement the markdown and code highlighting in the chat.

But another problem occured when I tried to stream AI's response. The response was streaming but the UI was messed up because of the streaming. Code highlighting was not working properly. 

So I had to use `react-syntax-highlighter` to highlight the code. It sure took time. But, this solved the problem and the chat was working perfectly.

A new problem arised when I tried to add authentication with Supabase and Server actions. Before this project, I had never used server actions and the caching and revalidation was a bit tricky. 

I took some time to understand the caching and revalidation and then I was able to implement the authentication with Supabase and server actions.

## Learnings

I learned a lot of things while developing this project. I learned how to use server actions with Supabase and how to use Vercel's AI SDK. I also learned how to work with markdowns and code highlighting.

I learned how to maintain a clean and readable codebase. I also learned how to maintain a good folder structure and naming conventions.

Most importantly, my UI/UX skills improved a lot. I learned how to make a beautiful UI and how to make the user experience seamless. I also learned how to use animations and gradients in a proper way to give a professional look to the UI.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot of new things and improved my skills. 

With all these features, I believe this project will be a great addition to my portfolio. 

I look forward to add more features to this project and make it even better. I also look forward to work on more projects like this and improve my skills even more.
