## Introduction

This is a fully functional simplified version of Twitter built using modern tech stack such as Nextjs, Prisma, Tailwind and MongoDB. 

It has all the features that a typical social media application has such as user authentication, posting tweets, liking and commenting on tweets, following and unfollowing users, and many more.

## Tech stack

The tech stack that I have used is Nextjs and react for frontend, Prisma and MongoDB for backend, Tailwindcss for styling, and NextAuth.js for user authentication. 

I have used combination of SWR and custom hooks for data fetching and maintaining its state. Zustand for modal's state management. 

I have deployed the application on Vercel and also integrated Vercel's Analytics and Speed Insights to track the performance of the application.

## Features

The application has authentication implemented using Next-Auth ensuring that only authenticated users can access the core functionalities of the application.

Users can update and delete their profile, and also can follow and unfollow other users. 

Tweets can be posted, liked and commented on.

A simple notification system is also implemented. Users will get notifications when someone likes or comments on their tweets, or when someone follows them.

## Problems

The most challenging part was to implement the user authentication. I have used NextAuth.js for user authentication. It was a bit difficult to understand how it works. But after spending some time I was able to implement it successfully. 

Another problem was to make it mobile responive and maintain the reusablity of the components. 

And to be honest, I didn't had any experience of backend development before this project. So, it was a bit difficult to understand how to use Prisma and MongoDB. I learned these technologies while building this project.

## Learnings

While building this there were a lot of things that I have learned, such as how to actually build a fullstack web application, from planning to development to maintaining the code and deploying the application. 

## Conclusion

It was a great experience as prior to this I was a frontend only guy. It gave a whole new perspective to my web development journey. I learned a lot of new things and I am happy with the outcome.

Looking forward to build more cool things in the future.
